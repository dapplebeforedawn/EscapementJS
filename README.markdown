#Escapement.js

This class performs the function of a bowl feeder escapment, randomly timed requests/events are fed in, which are then dispensed in an orderly, fixed rate.  It's also somewhat simliar to the event queue used by your web browser.

It's pretty simple code, but it's very nice to have this logic abstracted out of a larger piece of code.
